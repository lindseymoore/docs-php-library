What's New in 1.20
------------------

.. important:: MongoDB Server v3.6 End-of-Life

   Support for MongoDB Server v3.6 is removed in this release of the
   library.

- Adds support for MongoDB Server v8.0.

What's New in 1.18
------------------

- Adds a new GridFS API to make it more convenient to work with files using PHP's 
  existing filesystem functions. The :ref:`MongoDB\GridFS\Bucket::registerGlobalStreamWrapperAlias() <gridfs-bucket-register-global>` 
  method may be used to register a global alias for a GridFS bucket. After doing so, files within that bucket 
  can be accessed using only a file URI (e.g. "gridfs://mybucket/hello.txt"). A demonstration of this 
  API can be found in the `gridfs_stream_wrapper.php <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library/blob/1.18.0/examples/gridfs_stream_wrapper.php>`_ 
  example script.
