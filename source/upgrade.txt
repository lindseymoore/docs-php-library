This page describes the changes you must make to your application
when you upgrade to a new version of the {+driver-short+}.

Before you upgrade, perform the following actions:

- Ensure the new {+driver-short+} version is compatible with the {+mdb-server+} versions
  your application connects to and the PHP version your
  application compiles with. For version compatibility information, see the
  :ref:`{+driver-short+} Compatibility <php-compatibility>`
  page.
- Address any breaking changes between the driver version
  your application is using and your planned upgrade version in the
  :ref:`Breaking Changes <php-breaking-changes>` section.

.. tip::

   To ensure compatibility across {+mdb-server+} versions when
   upgrading driver versions, use the :ref:`{+stable-api+} <php-stable-api>`.

Breaking Changes
----------------

A breaking change is a change of a convention or a behavior starting in a specific
version of the driver. This type of change may prevent your application from working
properly if not addressed before upgrading the driver.

The breaking changes in this section are categorized by the driver version that introduced
them. When upgrading driver versions, address all the breaking changes between the current
and upgrade versions.

For more information on release changes, see the release notes and associated 
JIRA tickets for each release on `GitHub <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library/releases>`__.
